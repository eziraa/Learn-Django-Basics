## Organizing Models in Apps

- As we have see before apps are the building blocks of one peojct
- They used to reduce complexity
- They work in philosophy of `work one thing do it well`
- When we break down projects into multiple apps 
    - the apps should be
        1. Self-contianed
        2. Zero-Coupling
        3. High-Cohesion(focus)
- Let us create two other apps for our project

```bash
python manage.py startapp store
python manage.py startapp tags
```
