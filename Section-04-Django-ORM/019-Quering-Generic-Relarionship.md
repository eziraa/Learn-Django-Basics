## Quering Generic Relationship

- As we have seen before Generic relation ship means a relationship between to models which are found in diffrent model
- As the term  Generic indicates  that the relationship oneside (one model known) but the other side is generic means can be any model
- It used to reduse coupling
- In our model designing  TaggedItem has a generic relation ship  between Product model but we can change as follows

    - ___TaggedItem <---> Product___
    - ___TaggedItem <---> Article___
    - ___TaggedItem <---> Video___
    - ___TaggedItem <---> News___
